# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This assignment required me to use the third party API Day.JS and JQuery to create a simple calendar/ planner to record the days activities by leveraging the local storage.

## Tasks 

- Modified starter code to create a functioning calendar.
- Used Day.js to dynamically display today's date in the header of the HTML.
- Created a conditional statement that compared the time of the day to the timeblocks in the planner to determine if the time was in the present, past or future.
-   Created a save function that saves the text in each textblock to the local storage which then is retrieved on each pageload
